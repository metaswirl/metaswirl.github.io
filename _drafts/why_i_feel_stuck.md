# Why I feel stuck

1. Everything is about me
- Every failure, is my failure
- Who I choose for supervisor is my choice
- My research topic is my choice
- There seems to be no constant besides of myself

2. Every pond is deep
- Every piece is deep in itself. I never reach the ground anywhere. Wherever I go
someone has a better solution

3. My work organization sucks
- I pick up what is easy and let it go when it becomes hard
- I dwell onto technical challenges and loose the research focus 
- I do not know what I am going to do tomorrow

4. I do not see a field, I just see a collection of technologies

- Who are the key players?
- What are the recent developments?

5. Loss of trust to my supervisors and in my research group
