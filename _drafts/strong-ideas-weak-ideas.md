# Strong ideas, weak ideas

What are strong innovative ideas?

*Capitalist:* The ideas that when implemented provide a higher return of investment,
by making enough people open their pockets wide enough. High is determined by
comparing both the expected return of investment and the amount of involved risk
with other options on the market.

*Idealist:* Whatever makes the world a better place. Where "better" usually means
improvements in living standards of the world's populace and the health of the
ecosystem. In this understanding a weak idea is something that either helps
deteriorate the living standards of a large number of people or earth's
ecosystem, even though it might improve the situation for a minority.

The advantage of the capitalistic position, is that it is easily measurable, but it
might lead to overall negative long-term effects. The idealistic position is in turn
hard to measure as it depends on many complex systems, while it would in
principle lead to overall positive long-term effects.

Optimally one wants to have both: An idea that is at the same time viable from
a capitalistic stand-point and convincing from an idealistic stand-point.


## Weak ideas

Ideas that are minimally improving the comfort of an already very comfortably living populace. 

(water bottle with sensors, smart coffee machine and even Netflix)

These ideas although less meaningful intrinsically can be valuable when
well-executed.


## Strong ideas

1. Cheap products that improve the living standards or productivity for a large
   amount of people

Affordable Medicine and Hygiene
- Paper medicine
- Water Filter using sun rays (plus salt and lime)

Productivity and Education
- One Dollar Laptop

Fair markets and Anti-Corruption
- M-Farm (sharing information on prices for farmers)
- Uchaguzi (reporting violence)
- Abayima (writing data on SIM cards)


2. Medium-priced products that improve the productivity of a group of people

Simplify, automate, or remove tasks, which where tedious and counter-intuitive.

- Configuration Tools for e.g. switches

Reduce organizational complexity, e.g. by introducing new means of
communication

- Slack, Facebook, Yammer

Adding an intuitive interface for non-intuitive tasks

- Macintosh

3. Expensive-products that improve existing infrastructures

Finance
- Reducing transaction fees and delays with bitcoin/Blockchain technology
- Enabling more people to participate microcredits

Transport
- Make shipments traceable and thereby more reliable by using RFID

Production
- Equipping machines with sensors and analyzing the data live to recognize faults early on

4. Reaching new places

- New places for resources or production (space, deep sea)
- New places for technology (quantum computers, micromachines)
