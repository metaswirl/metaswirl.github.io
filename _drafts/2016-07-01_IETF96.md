The IETF 96 is going to meet Berlin this month and I did not want to miss this
opportunity. For those not familiar with the IETF, it is the organization
responsible for standardizing internet protocols. Multiple networking related
companies (Cisco, Juniper among others) and institutions are coming together in
working groups to develop and discuss proposals construct standards.

I had a look through the various working groups and found the working group
"Network Virtualization Overlays" closest to my research. In the community it
has been often discussed that the virtualization of computing resources, the
pillar of the Cloud's success, does usually not cover the network. A user can
reserve multiple computing nodes in the datacenter, but he has to rely on a
best-effort network connection between these networks. Instead the working group
tries to establish 

- Address isolation
- Traffic isolation for purposes of security and QoS
- Traffic reduction due to Multicast

Problems
- Sparse deployment, virtualized networks could be deployed over the whole
  datacenter
- Distributing and updating the mappings between the id of the virtual node
  address to the corresponging physical node address over endpoints (entry and
  exit)
- Incrementally deploying this new protocols without requiring complete
  overhauls of data centers
