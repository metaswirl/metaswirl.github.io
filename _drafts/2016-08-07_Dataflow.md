# Dataflow Programming Paradigm

In a data flow paradigm, a data set is moved between different static operators. It usually moves from a point of insertion (data source) to a point where it leaves the architecture (data sink). The path the data takes is mostly predefined by the static interconnection of operators, which can be modelled as a directed graph. Each operator takes one or more inputs and produces one or many outputs. An operators can keep state, but cannot access or manipulate the state of other operators.
