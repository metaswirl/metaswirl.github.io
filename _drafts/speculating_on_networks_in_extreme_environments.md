Mars

First settlement

Contingencies:
* High shipping cost:
 * With every increase in the shipping weight, the fuel cost increases
   exponentially?!
 * Yet as every rocket incurs an additional cost the shippings have to a minimum
   size
* No existing infrastructure (esp. no cables)
* Essential reliance on interplanetary communication

Needs
* Computing services for analysis
* Tracking of the infrastructure at all times
* Communication with exploration teams and with different sites

Consequence
* Lots of wireless communication on the ground
* Probably a number of orbiting satellites and few communication towers
* Computation equipment is transported in multiple parts, which might be
  assembled in space or on Mars
* Limited computing resources make flexible resource scheduling of compute and communication resources necessary
* A real game changer would be mobile factories, that (a) produce raw material
  on Mars or in the space and (b) construct machines from raw material. (These
factories could also be special kind of plants.) These factories would be able to
contain irregularities in the process and be either very robust or more likely self-repairing. Most likely they would keep track of the production process with a high number of sensors.
