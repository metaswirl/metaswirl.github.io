# How do you find an idea worth pursuing?

A start-up is hard work and a long-term investment. Even though it is en vogue
at the moment it is an endeavor that should be decided on with the utmost care.

Some people claim that the idea is not as important as getting the right team
together. That may be true, but in my experience having an interesting idea in
the first place will motivate other people to invest their precious time in the
team.

So how do you find a good idea?

Three ingredients:

## Fantasy - What you can dream up 
Just because you can dream up something does not mean you can build it. But
having a vision of how things can be gives you direction. (If you have a vision
without any followers, you are a nut case with overboarding fantasy. If you have a vision
plus one follower, you are a visionary.)

Who is your target user? Who experiences the problem you are solving? Who is affected by your idea?


## Skills - What you can build
Just because you can move mountains, does not mean you can realize anything
meaningful. However to have an idea or people without being able to create
something yourself means that you are just an annoyance telling people what to
do.

Where is your expertise? 
What part of you work feels easy? What hard?


## Relations - Who you can bring together
Just because you know people does not mean that you can do anything. But not
knowing the right persons can mean that you will not be able to take off.

If you do not have a brilliant idea:
Who would be willing to brainstorm with you?

If you had a brilliant idea:
Against who would you pitch it to get some general feedback?
Who actually has the problem and can tell you if you are spot on?
Who could give you insight into a related area?
Who would know about difficulties in production?
Who has already started a business and could tell you for what to watch out for?


Now if you are like me you have a little of each. For you and for me it is time
to carefully invest money and time in each of these.
