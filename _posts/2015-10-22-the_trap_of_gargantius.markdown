Maybe it is the winter, the low amount of natural light and the general colder
temperature, but every year at this time I feel the need to move my focus
inwards and ask: "Why?" Among the many "why's" resides the question: "Why do I
do I work for my current job and what do I want to accomplish?"

The former part of this question is more related to the human factor than
anything else. I do work where I work, because of the people that brought me
there and the colleagues that motivate me daily by their example. I owe them
much for their willingness to overlook the mistake I do every now and then and
for the many times they support me. Should you be among them, then a heartily
thank you for this year :-).

The other question is more difficult and leads to excessive speculation. Well no
better place, then to put it here. This questions leads me always to two
artifacts. One is a little story by Stanislaw Lem and the other is a small
acellular amoebae. Let me talk about the first and leave the second for some
other time. The story I am referring to is the "Trap of the Gargantius". It is
the story about two recent PhDs who travel the universe to find ways of
benefiting other life and world with their experience and knowledge.

They land on a world that is split in half by two embattling armies and people.
Both seem, while entertaining minor differences, to be mostly fascistic kingdoms.
They split and travel to the opposites kingdoms. And, although their fates
differ, they both at last get an audience with the respective king and offer him
to build a grandiose new weapon. With the following words, they promise to revolutionize the art of
warfare:

> What kind of army—he asked first—always emerged victorious? The one that had the
> finest leaders and the best disciplined soldiers. The leader gave the orders,
> the soldier carried them out; the former therefore had to be wise, the latter
> obedient. However, to the wisdom of the mind, even of the military mind, there
> were certain natural limits.

And further:

> The discipline of an army consisted in the precise execution of
> orders. Ideally, we would have a thousand hearts and minds molded into one
> heart, one mind, one will. Military regimens, drills, exercises and maneuvers
> all served this end.

Given this introduction they offer to build a mind connector that expands the
mental capacity of the individual, by connecting its brain with others. (This is
not so very dissimilar to one of my favourite franchises: Ghost in the Shell.
Here to the main characters are linked by a brain interface and are able to
communicate by sheer thought. But back to the story.) A small platoon connected
in such way becomes so effective that it takes down "three squadrons of the
King's dragoons". As expected the kings are convinced easily and order their
whole armies, basically all of their populations to be equipped with the device.

Both of the proud kings then send their armies to battle and the enhanced
soldiers hasten to the front line. As they meet with each others and
interconnect their intelligence and determination increase. Yet, and this is the
twist of this beautiful story, when their intelligence reaches a certain
threshold, they loose interest in the act of war and instead move their minds to
the arts and sciences. As the armies move towards each other they connect as
well and world peace is achieved instantaneously:


> Thus, though on the outside armor still gleamed, as well as the death-dealing
> steel of artillery, within there surged an ocean of mutual good will,
> tolerance, an all-embracing benevolence, and bright reason.

The story is a beautiful tale of how connecting humans can achieve good and
bring something new. It is an inspiration of what the internet can be. It
inspires me, first, to believe in the benevolent effect of a growing spread of
the internet. Secondly it inspires me, to believe that decentralisation, which
in our times means connecting various people without the involvement of institutions,
can help these people better understand each other. Often enough I ask myself,
what key technology can have a similar influence on the life of people.

A very good example is the money transfer system _M-Pesa_. This system, which is
heavily used in Africa enables users to send and receive money by use of their
mobile phones. Now, of course it is not a 100% example, as the users are still
contained by the companies offering this service, but it is a service that
greatly expands the possibilities (and btw it is a service that we are still
missing out on, at least in Germany) of the users. 

Another example are the countless web platforms to any topic imaginable. I just
recently bought a picture from a user on an art [related web
platform](http://deviantart.com) and I was suprised by how well it went.

I put my trust into these technologies and my aim is to create a technology that
follows the spirit of Gargantius. But before I leave you with this romanticism,
I should point out that there is darkness as well hidden in the story:

> Atrocitus himself saw how his cousin, the Grand Prince Bullion, desiring to raise the
> spirits of his soldiers, leaped into the fray, and how, as soon as he had hooked himself into
> the line, his spirit was literally spirited away, and he was no more.

It is the loss of individuality and character that comes from being completely
connected. But it is our unique personalities and the differences both large and
small, that inspire creativity. Giving these up for the sake of being connected,
means that we loose many facets that make this world special. So while this
trend is good in principle, it can have devastating results when the autonomy of
the individual is restricted. 

Thank you for following my story. And a Merry Christmas to you :-)
