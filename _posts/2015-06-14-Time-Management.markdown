# Academic Work & Time Management

Since I started my PhD in December six months ago, I learned many of the involved
challenges: How hard it is to balance the duties of teaching and research;
the difficulty in finding a relevant research area which makes use of most of my
skills and the involvement required for finding and keeping the right
connections with other researcher.

The common essential of all of these challenge is that Academic Work is, by its
nature, unstructured. As a young PhD you are supposed to stand on your own and
define your own research. Of course there are Professors and PostDocs eager to
put you to use in their research agenda, but their time is very limited. Quickly
it boils down to yourself and then you have to decide how to spend your time.

A very pragmatic example is the question on how much time you spent on reading
literature versus doing the actual work (attempting a proof, writing a program
or whatever your profession dictates). Fundamentally the work of a PhD is the
sum of the following activities: Research, Teaching, Learning and Organisation.
Each of these activities if not bounded can consume all of your time. There is
always a course to improve, a new skill to be learned or a new research/industry
partnership than can be organized. If you don't manage your time well you will
be consumed.

Thankfully there are resources available that help us in this difficult task.
When I started my PhD two of my more senior PhD colleagues recommended me the
excellent blog on great research by Nick Feamster and Alex Gray. One of their
many helpful posts is an article on [time management][1]. In the remainder of
this article I want to shed light on the proposed methods of the post augmented
with some of my own. 

### Time is not Time

When I speak about time, I don't so much mean time as in clock time, but time as
in effective time. It is easy to spent time on programming, but to doze off every
five minutes or so and browse the net for exciting, but completely
inconsequential news. It is elementary to create _barriers_ between leisure and work time, even
though it is not necessary to follow the traditional straight eight hour work period.
Another elementary aspect is that the leisure time contains sufficient exercise
so that your body is awake during the work time (although this seems to differ
from person to person).

Now, in the work time I found I have different sources for concentration. In my own
experience it is possible to spent different types of concentration on
creative thinking, focused work and communication. It happened to me that I
spent hours and hours on programming till I could see no more code, yet I could still easily
coordinate with my colleagues on research or teaching related questions. To
increase the available amount of effective time, you have to balance the type of
work you do. 

Finally both research and teaching consist of basic units: projects in research
and courses in teaching. To manage the available time I allocate _budgets_ (as
proposed by Feamster and Gray). However as the work is often very volatile my
budgets are on the order of days or half a days.


### Planning

When it comes to planning, I am very pragmatic. I only carry a list of tasks to
be done to each project. When I find time, I work on these tasks and when I
confront problems or open questions I add them to the task list. For me alone
this is enough. When working with a team and especially for meetings I really do
like agendas. Without agendas meetings tend to blow up and a lot of slack gets
added to the discussions. Even so it has been hard for me to allocate time for a
meeting. Most often I underestimate the required time for a meeting. In the
future I will follow Feamster and Gray and allocate 1.5 times the expected time
for each meeting.


### When Motivation is down

Most of my time these simple rules suffice. But sometimes, the weather is not
right, motivation is down and I just don't get started. In my undergrad life
that sometimes led to whole days being wasted. Nowadays I fall back to the
Pomodori method, which I encountered in the [Clean Coder][2]. For each task I
start a timer configured for 25 minutes. After that I take a short break. When I
feel ready again, I start another task and timer. During the 25 minutes I will
not accept interruptions or allow myself to become distracted. Often enough I
loose track of the time during this method and start working for longer times
following my own rhythm, but the Pomodori method jump-starts my motor. 

These are some of my own tricks and rules intermingled with the post from
Feamster and Gray. A last essential trick I got from reading the blog, was to
always start work before the break. Don't try to finish everything, but leave
something to continue in the next day. Similarly in closing this post I strongly
recommend you to read the post by [Feamster and Gray][1] ;)
